# Helium-Atom-Model
Models a helium atom (two electrons)
 Solved the problem of the helium atom ("two body problem") which has one nucleus and two electrons
 Modeled (x,y) coordinates of first electron as well as (z,u) coordinates of the second electron at time t
 Utilized MATLAB to code Runge Kutta 4 for prediction and Adams-Moulton for predictor corrector
 Produced final model in a data list as well as in a graphical form using Excel
